Hello! Welcome to fatcat2's Homework Repository.

If you're here, you've found the place where I keep all my APCS homework. If you ever do want to use any of the code found in this repository, just email me saying you did and credit in the correct areas of your own code. The code in this repository is not the exact answers for your homework, as all APCS courses differ. This repository is for my school, not yours.

Thanks and have fun!
